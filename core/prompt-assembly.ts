/*
 * amux — Agent Prompt Assembly
 *
 * Deliberate, reviewable composition of the coordination block that amux
 * APPENDS to the host agent runtime's base system prompt (it never replaces the base prompt).
 *
 * Section order is explicit and documented here so the prompt structure is
 * easy to review and test. Role profiles are one role-specific section, not
 * the whole prompt. Common operating principles, project vision, work state,
 * team context, and interface guidance are separate, ordered sections.
 *
 * Pi-independent and pure: takes pre-fetched section strings, returns the
 * composed block. The adapter gathers data and appends the result.
 */

/**
 * Common amux operating principles — the shared collaboration contract every
 * agent follows, regardless of role. Role-specific behavior lives in role
 * profiles; this section holds only universal coordination rules so the two
 * never conflict.
 */
export const COMMON_PRINCIPLES = `## amux Operating Principles

You are part of a coordinated agent team. Shared operating rules:

- **State is the source of truth.** Derive current truth from the backlog, registry, task comments, reservations, and journal — not from messages. Task assignments appear in your work state, not as inbox instructions.
- **Coordinate like a dev team.** Prefer \`amux_task comment\` for task-scoped discussion; use \`amux_discussion\` for cross-cutting team retros/brainstorms/design jams; use \`amux_send\` only for exceptional direct communication. Claim files via reservations before editing shared code.
- **Work the backlog deliberately.** Use \`amux_task summary\` (or \`/amux progress\`) for a hierarchical overview before choosing work. Items are typed (initiative/milestone/task/bug/chore/spec); initiatives and milestones are context containers — assign and pick executable leaf items, not containers. Inspect parent context with \`amux_task show\` before implementing a child item.
- **Review before done.** Substantive work goes to review before completion. Report outcomes, key decisions, risks, and test status.`;
